## Four Needs/Goals
* Collect and share restaurants with friends with ease.
* Filters for price, dietary restrictions (allergy, vegan/vegetarian), and ambience to match different needs.
* Simple rating system and authentic customer feedback to support better decisions.
* Easy to reserve or to get in the line for a restaurant.

## Four Problems/Frustrations
* Menus and operating hours are not kept up to date.
* Hard to coordinate because friends are in different locations.
* Real-time wait times are missing.
* Sponsored content/ads feel spammy or misleading.


## Product Vision Statement

 *NYC’s trusted dining guide powered by real diners—nearby picks with live hours and wait times, photo-verified reviews, and simple filters, whether you’re eating with friends or solo.*
